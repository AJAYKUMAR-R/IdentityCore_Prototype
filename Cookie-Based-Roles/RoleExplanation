Roles should loaded in the DB using script
In this project he hardcode the values and insert into db if the role wasn't there
but in the real enterprice application we should define the role and scope and we inserted into the db first

aspnetRole table => will hold the roles of the application
aspnetUserRole => will hold the relationship between the user and the roles

aspnetUserClaims => which will add the Claims which will be mapped to the user
aspNetRoleClaims => which will add the Claims it will be mapped to the roles.

Identity => is who you are (Authenticated details need for userName,Email,password)
Role => who you are given context (Employee,Admin,Guest)
Claim => A Piece of extra information about you (Department,Phone,PinCode)

Policy : This is decalrative approach for the doind another type of authentication
In this we will create policy which will needed a specific role and claim
    For an Instance : (Role : Admin) then (Claim => Department : Supervisor)
It can be specific to the user as well
    For an Instance : (Role : Guest) then (Claim => Age : 24) or above 24
