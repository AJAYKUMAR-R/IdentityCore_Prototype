<h1>Hello world</h1>
@* 
To prevent XSRF attacks we need to use the form tag or beginform html helper should be used 
because by default the application data would not be stealed by attacker by sending a mail click here
when user click he will get the data from his browser and navigate into it and he will use his cookie
to pretend like a actual user  *@
@* 
why we are using form tag by default it will have the token inside the html by .net feature though the user
steal the cooike he could not hit the server and get the data becuase he doesn't have antiforgery token *@

@* if you want to see it is failing you need to use normal html method or postman *@

<form asp-action="Index" asp-controller="Attack" method="post">
    <input asp-for="UserName" type="text"/>
    <input type="submit" value="submit" />
</form>
Trying to read the data from the server using jqery from the different origin without cross enabling
and successfully reproduced it as well
